This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis

## Introduction

This application was build because I was looking for a way of making it easier to remember and practice the difference commands in the terminal. Looking commands up and trying them out was cumbersome and I was looking for a way of having everything in the same place. So I created this app that will teach you the most used commands for terminal and git (though at this time not all commands are implemented).

## Technologies used

This project is build with front-end only in VueJS and VueX for state management. As the application grows I will use a database for storing the different scenarios. It is deployed on Heroku.
